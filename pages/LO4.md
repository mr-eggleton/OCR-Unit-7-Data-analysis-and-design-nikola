# LO4. Be able to present data analysis and design solutions to stakeholders

## P6
Prepare the data design
documentation for a presentation to
stakeholders


Learners should create data design documentation to reflect the data analysis and design solution to meet a specified business requirement. They
must produce a report or presentation that includes relevant diagrams to support and justify their explanations, ideally, using the design from P5 as
supporting evidence and potentially the logical data model in D1.

## M3
Present the data design
documentation to stakeholders


Learners must present their findings to the stakeholders. This could be as formal written report with relevant diagrams and a set of clear conclusions
and recommendations but as it is being presented there should be some narrative, either verbal or written, to underpin the delivery documentation.


## D2
Evaluate the logical data model
against the original specified business
requirement

Learners should evaluate their logical data design model against the original business requirements and justify any changes from the original
specification, making further recommendations in the light of the presentation in M3 and any potential feedback they may have received as a result.
